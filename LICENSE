        *** The Bej's cards (TM) v.1.0 ***

COPYRIGHT NOTE:
You may use this set of Bej's cards or any card from this file in your sigs,
ASCII drawings, programs, computer games or whatever. But no change
may be applied to any card itself. Mainly, don't remove the 'Bej'
text from the ace of hearts. Using more than 8 (eight) cards requires
adding a note in a program/graphics (e.g. 'This program uses Bej's cards').
When you distribute this file, please don't make any changes. No fee can be
taken for this file. If you want to collect payments for a program using
these cards, contact Bej.
In general, if you use any part of this file, please send me a note to
bej@druid.if.uj.edu.pl just for my pleasure.
